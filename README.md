TODO:
 
1. add AMD gpu miner's to mining resource page / maybe add some links to tutorials
2. developer resource list, like the verge ruby, php, node.js, python, & c# wrappers
3. put chat back in radio page.
4. add translations of website - possibly google
5. add documentation on rpc commands and flags, for instance, some users might not know they can use a different drive to store their blockchain data using the --datadir=D:\whatever\drive\and\directory\they\want
